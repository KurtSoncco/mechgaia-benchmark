# Mock STEP file for Level 3 Plate Optimization Task
# This represents a mounting plate with initial geometry
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary STEP file

# Initial mounting plate specifications:
# - Dimensions: 100mm x 80mm x 10mm
# - Material: Steel
# - Mounting holes: 4x M8 holes at corners
# - Load application point: Center of plate

# This file is used by the CADAnalysisTool for mock analysis
