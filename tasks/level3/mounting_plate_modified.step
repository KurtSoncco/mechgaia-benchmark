# Mock STEP file for Level 3 Plate Optimization Task - Modified Version
# This represents an optimized mounting plate with improved geometry
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary STEP file

# Modified mounting plate specifications:
# - Dimensions: 100mm x 80mm x 12mm (increased thickness)
# - Material: Steel
# - Mounting holes: 4x M8 holes at corners
# - Load application point: Center of plate
# - Added reinforcement ribs for improved stiffness

# This file is used by the CADAnalysisTool for mock analysis
